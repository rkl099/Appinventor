New serial component in appinventor.

I have done the following steps:
    re-refactored the physicaloid library that is used in my extension, to make it compatible with the original library.
    make an extension that is using this library, compile some test programs to app:s to verify that the new library has the same functionality.
    make modification to my local appinventor Serial.java to include the new functions.
    Make an app with my local build server and verify that it works the same as my extension

The new library can directly replace the old, and adds support for more serial adapters and resolve a number of issues.

The new Serial.java adds a number of functions and is functionally the same as my extension.

I have excluded the upload of hex-files to Arduino (just comment out in the code. Can be activated again). I donâ€™t think it should be in the serial component, maybe in a separate extension.

Changes to the old Serial.java as discussed in the thread are:
   Remove serial in method names.
   emove set and test buffer size,
   Rename PrintLn() to WriteLn() to be consistent with ReadLn().

I will at some time look at how I can add an AfterRead() that is a true call-back from the library to avoid the lock of the UI during large transfers. There are also some functions that I have not tested yet, bluetooth and wifi.
